Unsupervised Learning & EDA Repository
Overview

This repository contains a complete end-to-end workflow for exploring data and applying unsupervised learning techniques. It includes:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for understanding the dataset

Implementation of multiple unsupervised learning algorithms

Visualizations and insights for clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection

A learning resource that covers everything you need to know about unsupervised learning in practice


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA section covers:

Data loading and preprocessing

Summary statistics

Handling missing values and outliers

Feature scaling and transformation

Correlation analysis

Data visualization (histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps, pairplots, etc.)

Unsupervised Learning Techniques

This repository implements and explains:

Clustering

K-Means

Hierarchical Clustering

DBSCAN

Dimensionality Reduction

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

t-SNE

UMAP

Anomaly Detection

Isolation Forest

One-Class SVM

Visualizations

Cluster visualizations in 2D and 3D

PCA component plots

t-SNE embeddings

Heatmaps and dendrograms for hierarchical clustering

Installation and Setup
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/unsupervised-learning.git
cd unsupervised-learning

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

Open the Jupyter notebook to explore the workflow step by step:

Key Learnings

Understanding data before applying algorithms is crucial

Different clustering methods produce different results; there is no universal best method

Dimensionality reduction is powerful for visualization and noise reduction

Choosing the right number of clusters and hyperparameters is essential
